NoDA - NoSQL Data Access Operators
===
Abstaction layer for accessing NoSQL stores

This work provides a set of data operators for accessing heterogeneous NoSQL stores in a _unified_ manner.
The NoDA layer is ideal for developers and data analysts who want to execute queries on NoSQL databases without having to use their respective drivers and languages.
By means of a flexible interface, a user can perform simple and complex queries as well, based on their needs. Queries can also be performed via SQL statements, offering a cozy accessing manner to users with a basic knowledge of the SQL language.
So far, NoDA is built on top of **MongoDB**, **HBase**, **Redis** and **Neo4j** store.
